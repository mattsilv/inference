## About This Project

This Next.js application provides a simple, clean interface to compare different AI models across various providers, displaying pricing information, model parameters, and key specifications in an easy-to-read format.

## Features

- Interactive pricing table with model filtering and sorting
- Detailed model information cards
- Vendor and category filtering
- Responsive design for all devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattsilverman/inference.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd inference
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev:fast   # For improved hot-reloading (recommended)
```

Or use the standard server if you encounter issues:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Working with Model Data

The model data is organized in a vendor-based directory structure:

- Individual vendor model files are stored in `src/data/vendors/` (e.g., `openai.json`, `anthropic.json`)
- Vendor and category metadata are stored in `src/data/vendors.json` and `src/data/categories.json`
- The combined model data is automatically generated into `src/data/models.json`

#### Data Management

##### Source of Truth

This project follows a JSON-first approach for production:

- The JSON files in `/src/data` are the production source of truth
- The SQLite database (managed by Prisma) is used for local data management
- Both the database file and JSON files are committed to git
- Production builds only use the JSON files (not the database)

##### Data Management Commands

- `pnpm db:export` - Export database to JSON files (includes validation)
- `pnpm db:import` - Import JSON files into database (rare case)
- `pnpm validate-json` - Validate JSON files for correctness
- `pnpm prisma:studio` - Open Prisma Studio for database management
- `pnpm db:setup` - Set up database (create and seed)
- `pnpm db:reset` - Reset database (drop and recreate)
- `pnpm test:build` - Test the production build process locally

##### Development Workflow

1. Make data changes using Prisma Studio (`pnpm prisma:studio`)
2. Export changes to JSON files with `pnpm db:export`
3. Review JSON file changes in git
4. Commit both database and JSON files together
5. Test local production build with `pnpm test:build`

##### Automated Pricing Updates

The project includes an automated system for keeping model pricing up-to-date:

1. Generate tracking information with `pnpm run pricing:info`

   - This outputs a JSON file with all necessary vendor URLs and model information
   - Example: `pnpm run pricing:info > vendor-tracking-info.json`

2. Share this JSON file with an AI agent to fetch latest pricing:

   - The agent should use the exact URLs provided in the `pricingUrl` and `modelListUrl` fields
   - For each model, the agent should extract current input and output pricing
   - Agent must output data in the required format (see detailed process below)

3. Update the database with agent output using `npm run pricing:update <json-file-path>`

   - Example: `npm run pricing:update agent-pricing-output.json`
   - The system automatically records pricing history when changes are detected

4. Export the updated data to JSON files with `npm run pricing:export`
   - This updates all files in the `src/data` directory

##### Detailed Pricing Update Process

To update model pricing with the AI agent:

1. **Generate vendor tracking information**:

   ```bash
   npm run pricing:info
   ```
   
   This command automatically creates the vendor-tracking-info.json file in the project root.

2. **Share this file with your AI agent**, with these specific instructions:

   - "Use the exact URLs in pricingUrl and modelListUrl fields to visit vendor websites"
   - "For each model listed, extract the current price per 1M tokens for input and output"
   - "Return a JSON array with entries for each model in this exact format:"

   ```json
   [
     {
       "vendorName": "openai",
       "modelName": "gpt-4o",
       "inputPrice": 5.00,
       "outputPrice": 15.00,
       "finetuningInputPrice": null,
       "finetuningOutputPrice": null,
       "trainingCost": null
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```

3. **Update the database with agent output**:

   ```bash
   npm run pricing:update agent-pricing-output.json
   ```

4. **Export to JSON files**:
   ```bash
   npm run pricing:export
   ```

The system will automatically detect price changes and record them in the pricing history table.
