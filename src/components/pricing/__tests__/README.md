# Pricing Component Tests and Bug Fixes

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed infinite loop/crash when changing user numbers**:
   - Modified `TextInputArea.tsx` to use a metadata tag approach instead of string concatenation
   - Added a cap of 1000 users for calculations to prevent browser crashes
   - Text is no longer duplicated, which was causing memory issues with large multipliers

2. **Fixed calculation bug in cost estimates**:
   - Corrected `calculateOutputCost` usage in multiple components:
     - Fixed in `helpers.ts` for sorting models by price
     - Fixed in `TableView.tsx` for mobile card calculations
   - Previously using `calculateInputCost` for both input and output text

3. **Added comprehensive test suite**:
   - Created unit tests for formatters to verify token counting and cost calculations
   - Created tests for TextInputArea to verify multiplier handling
   - Created tests for helper functions to verify model sorting and filtering

## Additional Improvements

1. **Added safeguards**:
   - Added error handling in token multiplication
   - Added UI indicator when the user multiplier is capped
   - Implemented fallbacks for calculation failures

2. **Improved code quality**:
   - Fixed linting issues 
   - Added proper comments for maintainability
